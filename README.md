# crystal-fft-bpm
A tool to compute Bragg diffraction using fast beam propagation (BPM) method

We demonstrate the use of the Fast Fourier Transform Beam Propagation Method (FFT BPM) to simulate
dynamic diffraction effects, including scattering from deformed crystals with arbitrary shapes in Bragg, Laue, and
asymmetric geometries. The method’s straightforward algorithm, combined with FFT, enables fast computation
and is easy to implement in Python. It successfully reproduces literature results for bent crystals, dislocations,
and finite-shaped crystals simulated using the Takagi–Taupin equations. Python implementations for each case
are provided in this public GitHub repository, with the code structured for parallel computing.
